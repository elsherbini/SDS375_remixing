A substantial\ncomponent of this class will be dedicated to learning how to program in\nR. In addition, students will learn how to compile analyses and\nvisualizations into reports, how to make the reports reproducible, and\nhow to post reports on a website or blog.\nPrerequisites\nThe class requires no prior knowledge of programming. However,\nstudents are expected to have successfully completed an introductory\nstatistics class taught with R, such as SDS 328M, and they are expected\nto have some basic familiarity with the statistical language R.\nThis class is not a biology class, and no knowledge of biology is\nexpected. Thus, the class is suitable for anybody interested in data\nvisualization, including mathematicians, engineers, physicists, etc.\nTextbook\nThis class draws heavily from materials presented in the following\nbook:\nClaus O. Wilke. Fundamentals of Data\nVisualization. O’Reilly Media, 2019.\nAdditionally, we will also make use of the following books:\nHadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen. ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data\nAnalysis, 3rd ed. Springer, to appear.\nKieran Healy. Data Visualization: A\nPractical Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2018.\nAll these books are freely available online and you do not need to\npurchase a physical copy of either book to succeed in this class.\nTopics covered\n\nClass\nTopic\nCoding concepts covered\n1.\nIntroduction, reproducible workflows\nRStudio setup online, R Markdown\n2.\nAesthetic mappings\nggplot2 quickstart\n3.\nTelling a story\n\n4.\nVisualizing amounts\ngeom_col(),\ngeom_point(), position adjustments\n5.\nCoordinate systems and axes\ncoords and position scales\n6.\nVisualizing distributions 1\nstats, geom_density(),\ngeom_histogram()\n7.\nVisualizing distributions 2\nviolin plots, sina plots, ridgeline\nplots\n8.\nColor scales\ncolor and fill scales\n9.\nData wrangling 1\nmutate(),\nfilter(), arrange()\n10.\nData wrangling 2\ngroup_by(),\nsummarize(), count()\n11.\nVisualizing proportions\nbar charts, pie charts\n12.\nGetting to know your data 1: Data\nprovidence\n\n13.\nGetting to know your data 2: Data quality\nand relevance\nhandling missing data,\nis.na(), case_when()\n14.\nGetting things into the right order\nfct_reorder(),\nfct_lump()\n15.\nFigure design\nggplot themes\n16.\nColor spaces, color vision deficiency\ncolorspace package\n17.\nFunctions and functional programming\nmap(), nest(),\npurrr package\n18.\nVisualizing trends\ngeom_smooth()\n19.\nWorking with models\nlm, cor.test,\nbroom package\n20.\nVisualizing uncertainty\nfrequency framing, error bars,\nggdist package\n21.\nDimension reduction 1\nPCA\n22.\nDimension reduction 2\nkernel PCA, t-SNE, UMAP\n23.\nClustering 1\nk-means clustering\n24.\nClustering 2\nhierarchical clustering\n25.\nVisualizing geospatial data\ngeom_sf(),\ncoord_sf()\n26.\nRedundant coding, text annotations\nggrepel package\n27.\nInteractive plots\nggiraph package\n28.\nOver-plotting\njittering, 2d histograms, contour\nplots\n29.\nCompound figures\npatchwork package\n30.\nReview\n\n\nComputing requirements\nProgramming needs to be learned by doing, and a significant portion\nof the in-class time will be dedicated to working through simple\nproblems. All programming exercises will be available through a\nweb-based system, so the only system requirement for student computers\nis a modern web browser.\nCourse site\nAll materials and assignments will be posted on the course webpage\nat: https://wilkelab.org/SDS375\nAssignments will be submitted and grades will be posted on Canvas at:\nhttps://utexas.instructure.com\nR compute sessions are available at: https://edupod.cns.utexas.edu\nNote that edupods will be unavailable due to maintenance approximately\ntwo hours per month, usually on a Thursday afternoon between 4pm and\n6pm. Specific maintenance times are published in advance here: https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/RCTFusers\nAn online discussions forum will be available at the following\nprivate GitHub repo: https://github.com/wilkelab/SDS375_spring2022 You\nwill be given access to this repo during the first week of class.\nAssignments and grading\nThe graded components of this class will be homeworks, projects, and\nonline participation. Each week either one homework or one project is\ndue. Homeworks will be relatively short visualization problems to be\nsolved by the student, usually involving some small amount of\nprogramming to achieve a specified goal. Projects are larger and more\ninvolved data analysis problems that involve both programming and\nwriting. Students will have at least one week to complete each homework\nand two weeks to complete each project. The submission deadlines for\nhomeworks and projects will be Mondays at 11am.\nThere will be ten homeworks and three projects. Both homeworks and\nprojects need to be submitted electronically on Canvas. Homeworks are\nworth 10 points and projects are worth 100 points. The lowest-scoring\nhomework will be dropped, so that a maximum of 90 points can be obtained\nfrom the homeworks.\nOnline participation assignments are small tasks meant to promote\ndiscussion and engagement with the class materials. They are worth\nbetween 5 and 10 points, for a maximum of 60.\n\nAssignment type\nNumber\nPoints per assignment\nTotal points\nHomework\n9 (+1)\n10\n90\nProject\n3\n100\n300\nParticipation\n9\n5-10\n60\n\nThus, in summary, each project contributes 22% to the final grade,\nthe totality of all homeworks contributes another 20% to the final\ngrade, and participation contributes 13%. There are no\ntraditional exams in this class and there is no final.\nThe participation assignments are meant to foster discussion about\nclass materials on GitHub. Several of them can be performed more than\nonce and will receive the indicated points each time they are performed\nsuccessfully, up to the maximum number of times the specific activity is\nrewarded or the point maximum of 60, whichever is reached earlier. The\nfollowing activities will be available:\n\nParticipation assignment\nPoints\nTimes rewarded\nSubmit GitHub username\n5\n1x\nMake a comment in the sandbox\n5\n1x\nOpen an issue\n10\n3x\nProvide a constructive comment\n5\n6x\nClose an issue that was answered\n5\n3x\n\nThe class will use +/- grading, and the exact grade boundaries will\nbe determined at the end of the semester. However, the following minimum\ngrades will be guaranteed:\n\nPoints achieved\nMinimum guaranteed grade\n405 (90%)\nA-\n360 (80%)\nB-\n315 (70%)\nC-\n225 (50%)\nD-\n\nLate assignment policy\nHomeworks that are submitted past the posted deadline will not be\ngraded and will receive 0 points.\nProject submissions will have a 2-day grace period. Projects\nsubmitted during the grace period will have 25 points deducted from the\nobtained grade. After the grace period, students who have not submitted\ntheir project will receive 0 points.\nParticipation assignments will be open for several weeks each and\nwill be spaced approximately evenly throughout the semester, so that\nstudents have to demonstrate consistent participation to achieve full\npoints.\nExtra assignment\nfor graduate course credit\nGraduate students who are taking this class for graduate course\ncredit will have to complete one additional assignment. The assignment\nwill be to write a brief report (4-5 pages, no more than 3 figures)\napplying concepts from this class to a dataset of the student’s choice.\nThis assignment will be graded pass/fail, and a failing grade on this\nassignment will result in a 10% penalty on the total points obtained in\nthe class. Students who receive a failing grade can submit a revised\nassignment for regrading. The last day by which a revised assignment can\nbe submitted is the last day of class in the semester.\nOffice hours\nBoth the graduate TAs and myself will be available at posted times or\nby appointment. Office hours will be over Zoom. The most effective way\nto request an appointment for office hours outside of posted times is to\nsuggest several times that work for you. I would suggest to write an\nemail such as the following:\nDear Dr. Wilke,\n\nI would like to request a meeting with you outside of \nregular office hours this week. I am available Thurs.\nbetween 2pm and 3:30pm or Fri. before 11am or after 4pm.\n\nThanks a lot,\n  John Doe\nNote that we will not usually make appointments before 9am or after\n5pm.\nEmail policy\nWhen emailing about this course, please put “SDS375” into the subject\nline. Emails to the instructor or TA should be restricted to\norganizational issues, such as requests for appointments, questions\nabout course organization, etc. For all other issues, post an issue on\nGitHub, ask a question during open Zoom, or make an appointment for a\none-on-one session.\nSpecifically, we will not discuss technical issues related to\nassignments over email. Technical issues are questions concerning how to\napproach a particular problem, whether a particular solution is correct,\nor how to use the statistical software R. These questions should be\nposted as issues on GitHub. Also, we will not discuss grading-related\nmatters over email. If you have a concern about grading, schedule a\none-on-one Zoom meeting.\nSpecial accommodations\nIn-person attendance is not required. While the\nclass is set up as an in-person class, there is no strict requirement\nfor attendance. No grade component depends on any in-person activity,\nand every effort will be made to provide students with online access to\ncourse materials.\nStudents with disabilities. Students with\ndisabilities may request appropriate accommodations from the Division of\nDiversity and Community Engagement, Services for Students with\nDisabilities, 512-471-6259, https://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/\nReligious holy days. Students who must miss a class\nor an assignment to observe a religious holy day will be given an\nopportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after\nthe absence. According to UT Austin policy, such students must notify me\nof the pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of\nobservance of a religious holy day.\nAcademic dishonesty\nThis course is built upon the idea that student interaction is\nimportant and a powerful way to learn. We encourage you to communicate\nwith other students, in particular through the discussion forums\non GitHub. However, there are times when you need to demonstrate\nyour own ability to work and solve problems. In particular, your\nhomeworks and projects are independent work, unless explicitly stated\notherwise. You are allowed to confer with fellow students about general\napproaches to solve the problems in the assignments, but you have to do\nthe assignments on your own and describe your work in your own words.\nStudents who violate these expectations can expect to receive a failing\ngrade on the assignment and will be reported to Student Judicial\nServices. These types of violations are reported to professional\nschools, should you ever decide to apply one day. Don’t do it—it’s not\nworth the consequences.\nSharing of Course\nMaterials is Prohibited\nAny materials in this class that are not posted publicly may not be\nshared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my\nexplicit, written permission. This includes but is not limited to\nlecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers,\nprojects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and\nadditional problem sets. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes\ncheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and\nan act of academic dishonesty. We are well aware of the sites used for\nsharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated\nwith you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be\nreported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the\nDean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including\nfailure in the course.\nAny materials posted on the public class website (https://wilkelab.org/SDS375/) are considered public and\ncan be shared under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0\nlicense.\nClass Recordings\nAny class recordings provided are reserved only for students in this\nclass for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The\nrecordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation\nof this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct\nproceedings.\nReuse\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
